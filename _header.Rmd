# Overview {.tabset}

- Researcher: [Sudhir Tattikota](mailto:sudhir_gt@hms.harvard.edu)
- Primary Investigator: [Norbert Perrimon](mailto:perrimon@genetics.med.harvard.edu)
- Experiment: *Drosophila* blood immune cell profiling with single-cell RNA-seq


## Run 1

2000 cells were sequenced using the [inDrop][] v3 platform. 

- `M`: Data for another group
- `sorted`: Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted GFP+ immune cells.
- **`unsorted`**: All cells. Note that this group is also GFP+.

Only `sorted` and `unsorted` samples are relevant to the analysis.


## Run 2

Additional samples were sequenced also using [inDrop][]:

- **`SEP`**: sepsis treatment
- **`PC1`**: prick control (replicate 1)
- **`UC`**: untreated control
- `PC2`: prick control (replicate 2)
- `UNS OP`

Per Sudhir's request, focus the analysis on the PC1 (injury/prick control 1), SEP (sepsis), and UC (untreated control) samples.


## Run 3

Additional [inDrop][] replicates:

- PC (1.1, 2.1)
- UC (1.1, 2.1)
